Create the following web services:
GET api/students  - returns all students
Students have id, name and grade
GET api/students/{studentId}/marks - returns the marks of a student
Marks have subject and score
No need to use a database, xml file or any other kinds of data storage. You can use a regular array.
Using the web services develop a client application with two "pages"
On the first page show all students
The second page shows the marks of a student
Load the second page when a student from the first is clicked
Separate the application in the following modules:
HttpRequester - performs HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests
DataPersister - uses HttpRequester to fetch data from the storage (the web services)
Controls - renders objects to HTML elements
Application - handles event handlings, page load, etc…
(cont.) Using the web services develop a client application with 2 "pages"
Use promises for the HTTP requests
You can use Q.js, RSVP.js or any other library
Use RequireJS to define and use your modules
Use mustache.js for templating the data
Use jQuery, prototype.js or native XmlHttpRequest to make the AJAX calls





Implement a ComboBox control (like a dropdown list)
The ComboBox holds a set of items (an array)
Initially only a single item, the selected item, is visible (the ComboBox is collapsed)
When the selected item is clicked, all other items are shown (the ComboBox is expanded)
If an item is clicked, it becomes the selected item and the ComboBox collapses
Each of the items in a ComboBox can contain any valid HTML code
.) Implement a ComboBox control (like a dropdown list)
Use RequireJS and mustache.js
jQuery is not obligatory (use it if you will)
