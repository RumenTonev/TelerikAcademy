Create an AJAX-enabled Web site which shows Employees among and their Orders in two GridView controls (use the Northwind database and Entity Framework.) Put the GridView for the orders inside an update panel. Add UpdateProgress which shows an image while loading (simulate slow loading with Thread.Sleep()).
When the user selects a row in employees GridView, the UpdateProgress must be activated and the panel must be updated with the orders of the selected Employee.
